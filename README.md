# Pipecraft
Stop rewriting the same CI/CD and Docker setup.  
Pipecraft is a collection of clean, production-ready boilerplates across multiple languages, each one complete with:
- ✅ Dockerized setup
- ✅ CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Why Pipecraft?
Because I've written that same Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflow one too many times.  
Because I just want to start building without reinventing the boilerplate wheel every time.  
Because context switching between Go, Rust, Python, and TypeScript shouldn’t mean going back to square one.  

## Getting Started
```sh
docker compose up -d
```
